/* This policy file defines the permissions for the employee client.
   It grants to the classes codebase permission to connect and resolve
   socket connections to any host on ports greater than 1024. Hosts are
   not limited to allow this example to work with the client on one machine
   and the employee object server on another machine.
   Note that permission to the rmiregistry port alone
   is not sufficient for this example to run successfully. The
   stub and skeleton must communicate using un-privileged ports.
   Note also that the file protocol on Windows must be a single slash:
     file:/${...
   whereas on linux, the file protocol must be a double slash file://${...
