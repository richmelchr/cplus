/* This policy file defines the permissions for the employee server.
   It grants to the classes codebase permission to connect, accept
   and resolve socket connections to any host on ports greater than
   1024. Hosts are not limited to allow this example to work with the
   client on one machine and the employee object server on another.
   Note that permission to the rmiregistry port alone
   is not sufficient for this example to run successfully. The
   stub and skeleton must communicate using un-privileged ports.
   Note also that the file protocol on Windows must be a single slash:
     file:/${...
   whereas on linux, the file protocol must be a double slash file://${...
   I don't know whether this is intentional or just a consequence of
   my development environment (versions).
